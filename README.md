# Cosuite: Software for better online synchronous classes and meetings

This is a suite of open-source web software tools that work well together (or separately)
with the goal of online meetings that approximate the quality of in-person meetings:

1. [**Comingle**](https://github.com/edemaine/comingle) provides multiroom meetings with persistent apps/state within rooms
   * Integrates Cocreate, Coauthor, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, and any other iframe-compatible web page/app
2. [**Cocreate**](https://github.com/edemaine/cocreate) provides collaborative whiteboards
   * Vector drawing, freehand with pressure sensitivity, cursor sharing, multipage, LaTeX, version history
3. [**Coauthor**](https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor) provides collaborative note-taking
   * Everyone can write/read/organize notes/progress/ideas/questions (text/math/images) collaboratively in real time
